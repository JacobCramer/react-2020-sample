#Jacob Cramer 2020 Code Sample

This is a sample of my work, intended to show my skills with the **JavaScript** language when developing for a browser environment. While I've prettied things up with a bit of CSS, the focus is on the JavaScript components. This particular variation is built using **React** and **Redux** in an **ES9** environment.

For convenience, this repo has been pushed with a pre-built version included, allowing you to view the page as is without needing to install the development environment. **You can also view a live version of the page [here](https://jacobcramer.github.io/react-2020-sample/).**

I'm releasing this code freely under the **MIT license**. If you're not familiar with the license, it's a short, simple, highly permissive license that lets you do nearly anything you want.
